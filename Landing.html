        <p> Jordan has wanted to be a Tri-Circle D Ranch Hand for a few years now. When she was a front desk agent at the All-star resorts, 
she went on a trail ride and spoke with a girl named Kara who was working as a trail guide. While on the ride, Jordan expressed that it was her dream role 
to work as a ranch hand. Kara gave her ideas and tips on how to achieve her goals. When applications posted, she applied right away. Jordan had a riding interview 
and it went well, however, she was not in Disney's transfer system guidelines. Due to this, she was not offered a role at Tri-Circle D Ranch. 
Unfortunately she ran into an obstacle, but that didn't stop her from trying again. A year later, March of 2020 she applied again, but she met another obstacle. 
The Covid-19 pandemic had just begun and she thought her application was lost in translation. After a couple of long months in October 2020 Jordan received her call!  
The ranch remembered who she was after all that time. Instead of interviewing again, the ranch offered her a role. Today Jordan lives her dream at the Tri-Circle D Ranch 
working with her good friend Kara. She gets to work with some of the most magical horses in the world!
